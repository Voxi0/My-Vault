## Newton's Second Law of Motion
**The acceleration of an object is proportional to the resultant force acting on it and inversely proportional to the object's mass**

An object will accelerate in response to a resultant force. The bigger this resultant force, the greater the acceleration. For a given force, the greater the object's mass, the smaller the acceleration experienced.
$$
\large \text
{Force} \ (N) =
\text {Mass} \ (kg)
\times
\text {Acceleration} \ (m/s^2)
$$
