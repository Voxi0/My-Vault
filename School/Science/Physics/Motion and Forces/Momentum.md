## Momentum
The tendency of an object to keep moving. Momentum is a vector quantity as it has a direction and a magnitude. Conservation of momentum is that total momentum before and after a collision remains the same.
$$
\large \text
{Momentum} \ (kg \ m/s) =
\text {Mass} \ (kg)
\times
\text {Velocity} \ (m/s)
$$
The following formula can be used to find the force using change in momentum and time.
$$
\large \text
{Force} \ (N) =
\frac
	{\text {Change in Momentum}}
	{\text {Time}}
$$
