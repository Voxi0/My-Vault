## Newton's Third Law of Motion
**For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction**

In every interaction, there's a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects.

The size of the forces on the first object is equals to the size of the forces on the second object.

The direction of the force on the first object is always opposite to the direction of the force on the second object.

Forces always comes in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.
