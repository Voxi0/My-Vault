## Stopping Distance
The total distance travelled from when a driver spots a hazard up-to when they completely stop.
$$
\large \text
{Stopping Distance} \ (m) =
\text {Thinking Distance} \ (m)
+
\text {Braking Distance} \ (m)
$$
The thinking distance is the distance travelled by the driver whilst reacting to a hazard. It is the reaction time. It is affected by things like age, drugs, illness, tiredness and distractedness.

On the other hand, the braking distance is the distance travelled before the car completely stops. This is affected by the speed of the car, it's tires, brakes and road conditions.
