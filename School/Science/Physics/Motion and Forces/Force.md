## Force
Forces makes things start moving or stop moving. Not that they aren't required to keep an object moving. It's a vector quantity as it has a size and direction. Force is measured in Newtons ($N$). Some common forces includes thrust, weight and friction.

Force can be measured using a Newton Meter which has a spring that gets pulled down the more the force is applied.
