## Acceleration
Acceleration is the change in speed or velocity of an object over a certain time.

We also sometimes refer to a moving object as having a 'constant acceleration' or a 'uniform acceleration'. A constant or uniform acceleration means that the speed of the object changes by the same amount every second.

When the speed of an object is decreasing with time (ie slowing down), the object's speed is changing and so, by definition, the object is accelerating. If the velocity of an object is decreasing, the acceleration calculated will be negative.
$$
\large \text
{Acceleration} \ (m/s^2) =
\frac
	{\text {Change in Speed \ (m/s)}}
	{\text {Time Taken} \ (s)}
$$
$$
\large \text
{Final Speed} \ (m/s) =
\text {Initial Speed} \ (m/s) \ +
\text {Acceleration} \ (m/s^2)
\times
\text {Time Taken} \ (s)
$$
