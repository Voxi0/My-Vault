## Distance-Time Graphs
A distance-time graph shows how the distance and speed of an object changes over time. It represents the total distance travelled by an object over time. It illustrates the total distance covered by an object as time progresses.

If an object moves along a straight line, the distance travelled can be represented by a distance-time graph.

In a distance-time graph, the gradient of the line is equal to the speed of the object. The greater the gradient (and the steeper the line) the faster the object is moving.
#### Key Characteristics
- **Gradient:** The gradient of the line on a distance-time graph represents the speed of the object.
- **Straight Lines:** Represents constant speed.
- **Curved Lines:** Indicates changing speed (acceleration or deceleration).
