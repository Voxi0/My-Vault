## Speed
Speed is a measure of how fast an object is moving. It's typically measured in metres per second ($m/s$). It's a scalar quantity.
$$
\large \text
{Speed} \ (m/s) =
\frac
	{\text {Distance} \ (m)}
	{\text {Time} \ (s)}
$$
$$
\large \text
{Time} \ (s) =
\frac
	{\text {Distance} \ (m)}
	{\text {Speed} \ (m/s)}
$$
$$
\large \text
{Distance} \ (m) =
\text {Speed} \ (m/s)
\times
\text {Time} \ (s)
$$
