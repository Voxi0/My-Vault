## Velocity
Velocity is a measure of how fast an object is travelling in a certain direction. Because it has a magnitude and a direction, it's a vector quantity. The units of velocity are in metres per second ($m/s$).
$$
\large \text
{Velocity} \ (\frac {m} {s}) =
\frac
	{\text {Distance} \ (m)}
	{\text {Time} \ (s)}
$$
$$
\large \text
{Time} \ (s) =
\frac
	{\text {Distance} \ (m)}
	{\text {Velocity} \ (\frac {m} {s})}
$$
$$
\large \text
{Distance} \ (m) =
\text {Velocity} \ (\frac {m} {s})
\times
\text {Time} \ (s)
$$
