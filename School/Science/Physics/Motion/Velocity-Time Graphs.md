## Velocity-Time Graphs
The gradient of a velocity-time graph at a particular time gives the acceleration of the object at that time.

The area under a velocity-time graph gives us the displacement.
$$
\large \text
{Gradient (Acceleration)} =
\frac
	{\text {Change in Velocity}}
	{\text {Change in Time}}
$$
