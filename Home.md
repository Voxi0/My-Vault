Welcome to my vault! I know I know, it's not a huge collection of notes, but it's something right? I mean come on give me break, I started using Obsidian seriously only from April 2025 so it's not really *my* fault.

Anyways, I'm a retarded 16yo computer science, programming and Linux enthusiast who likes many things. I really love Obsidian and the idea of taking notes mainly because I'm a much bigger fan of typing rather than writing.

I love games like Half Life, Silent Hill 2, DOOM, Ultrakill, Yume Nikki etc. And as for songs, I really like the Alan Parsons Project, Queen, Nirvana, Radiohead etc.
