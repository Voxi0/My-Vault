Architecture in software refers to the underlying structure/foundation of a piece of software. It defines how components of a software system are assembled and work together. It serves as a blueprint for software application development and provides a basis for the developer team.

A well-designed software architecture is crucial for delivering high-quality software products. It provides a structured solution, balances stakeholder needs, and ensures the system's performance, reliability, and maintainability.

With that being said, let's discuss computer hardware architectures. The architecture of a computer system dictates how each hardware component of a computer system should interact with one another and how a piece of software can interact with the hardware. The computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost and reliability of a computer system. There are various computer architectures out there. Let's discuss them :P
## Von-Neumann Architecture
Also known as the Princeton architecture, this was developed by John Von Neumann. This is the most popular and widely used computer architecture and is therefore, the foundation for most modern computer systems. This architecture includes a Central Processing Unit (CPU) with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and registers, a memory unit to store data and instructions, external mass storage, a Control Unit (CU), and input/output mechanisms. The key feature of this architecture is that it uses a single memory space for both data and instructions, making it simpler to implement.
## Harvard Architecture
The **Harvard architecture** separates the storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. This means it has distinct memory sections for code and data, allowing simultaneous access to both. This architecture is often used in embedded systems and microcontrollers. A typical example is the punch card system. Modern computers may incorporate elements of both Harvard and Von-Neumann architectures.
