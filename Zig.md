This is my collection of notes about the Zig programming language which I absolutely adore. It's still a very young language and as of writing this, the latest stable version/release is 0.14 but I'm using the unstable release which is 0.15 so be aware of that.

Zig is a very, very nice low-level, systems programming language that bears a striking resemblance to C in terms of the syntax, but has many cool and modern features that makes it really enticing for me. Rust is more established and all but Zig is way simpler and nicer to learn + use in my honest opinion.
