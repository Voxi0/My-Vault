## Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
A bitmap image format developed and released on the 15th of June 1987. The format can contain up to 8 bits per pixel which allows a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colours chosen from the 24-bit RGB colour space.

GIFs are often used for animated images however they are usually low-quality, distracting, can slow down websites and doesn't work on all platforms.
## Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
A raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. It was developed as an improved replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colours), greyscale images (With or without an alpha channel for transparency).

This format was designed primarily for transferring images on the internet, not for professional-quality print graphics. Because of this, PNG images don't support non-RGB colour spaces such as CMYK.

A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of chunks, encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks.
## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
An XML-based vector graphics format for defining 2D graphics, having support for interactivity and animation. It's an open source standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1999.
## Tag Image File Format (TIFF)
An image file format for storing raster graphics popular among graphics artists, the publishing industry and photographers. TIFF is widely supported by scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition, image manipulation etc.

The format was created by Aldus corporation for use in desktop publishing in the Autumn of 1986 after two major earlier draft releases.

TIFF is a complex format, defining many tags of which typically only a few are used in each file. This led to implementations supporting many varying subsets of the format, a situation that gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for *Thousands of Incompatible File Formats*.
## Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG / JPG)
A commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade off between storage size and image quality.

Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used digital image format with several billion JPEG images being produced everyday as of 2015.
