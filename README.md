## About
This is my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault (obviously). Here, I store all my notes about all sorts of things like [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Nix](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)>), computer science etc.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a really cool tool for note-taking and I'm absolutely loving it so far. It works great on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) even though I'm using a [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor - [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), not an [Xorg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).
