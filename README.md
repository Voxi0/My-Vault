# My Obsidian Vault
Obsidian is a really cool note-taking app that's completely free to use. I just recently discovered it and so far it's really good. It works great on Linux, even with window managers like Hyprland.

Anyways this is my vault (obviously) where I store all my notes about pretty much everything. School stuff, Linux, Nix, programming etc. I'm a CS and Linux/Nix enthusiast but I do have to study as well.
