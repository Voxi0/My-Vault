## OSDev
OSDev is really cool and teaches us a lot about how operating systems works. Operating systems do a lot of work including managing memory. So making an operating system will teach us a lot about memory management as we have to make a memory manager after all. There aren't a whole lot of resources for OSDev though and making an operating system means we have to do a lot of reading and go through a lot of spec sheets for various things. But it's really fun (Maybe because I'm a masochist).

Now to be more specific. We will be making an x86 64-bit (Because modern) operating system. And our goal is to make it so that this OS actually works on real hardware, not just an emulator.

We'll use the C language, Limine bootloader to boot our OS, SSFN for fonts and a tiny printf implementation for, printf (Duh). These are the bare basic stuff we need, we'll go on from there.
