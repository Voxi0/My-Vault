## Emulator
Making an emulator seems really fun and also can teach us a lot about hardware. Like how the CPU works for example as making an emulator means that we have to emulate hardware using code.

There's lots of resources as to how to make an emulator, at least much more than how to make an operating system. And we can learn a lot about the inner workings of a piece of hardware.

First emulator we should make is a 6502 emulator or a CHIP-8 (Virtual console) emulator. The 6502 is an incredibly simple 8-bit processor and is super popular and well documented. So it's a really good idea to start with that.
