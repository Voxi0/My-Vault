A simple and bare-bones general-purpose, imperative, procedural low-level systems programming language that was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, C remains an extremely influential and widely used programming language to this day. It inspired many languages that came after hence why they bear many similarities to C.

Although considered a low-level language in modern day standards, it was considered a very high-level language back when it was released as back in the day, people would carve punch cards out of granite and had to deal with the drudgery of lower-level languages such as Assembly.
## Performance and Efficiency
C is a very efficient language which can easily deliver high-performance. This is due to the fact that it's a compiled language meaning that it is translated to highly-efficient and optimized machine code instructions. This also makes it possible for the programmer to directly talk to the hardware rather easily as well, compared to lower-level languages like Assembly at least. C also has minimal runtime support which is rather impressive.
## Portability
It's also an extremely portable language and the same C code with minimal changes can be trivially compiled for various systems making it a very handy language as before C, programmers would have to rewrite pretty much their entire Assembly program for each and every system that they desired to support.
## What C is Used For
Unsurprisingly, C is primarily used for creating operating systems, drivers, embedded software and other such low-level software because it's high-level while also allowing low-level direct access to the hardware of course. And all this while maintaining insanely good portability too. And of course since the language is so simple and minimal, it's very easy to pick up. It's also very efficient and can easily deliver high performance making it perfect for performance-critical applications such as anything related to embedded systems of course.

However, C forces the the programmer to do a lot of heavy lifting and write code to implement a lot of things you take granted from modern languages by hand e.g. linked lists.

Java provides a decent implementation of linked lists that a programmer can use immediately but with C, they have to write their own.

And another thing to keep in mind is that while C can deliver high-performance, it's easy to write bad code and lose all performance benefits by slowing down your program.

C doesn't hold your hand like most other languages do making it a rather dangerous language to use. It's very common to have memory leaks, segmentation faults and other issues with C as it forces you to manually manage memory making C a notorious language as one of the most difficult languages to learn.

Although the language is small and easy-to-learn, mastering the concepts and being able to use C perfectly is downright near impossible.
