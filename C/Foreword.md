These are just a random collection of notes going through more or less everything I learn about C that's hopefully quick and easy to read as a nice way to revise parts of this amazing language. I believe writing notes and practicing ones skills is the best way to learn stuff so yeah.

These notes are heavily based on the book [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) which is a completely free online resource to learn modern C programming. It's a fairly small, easy-to-read and simple book and is amazing for learning modern C in my honest opinion. I hold it in high regards and have a lot of respect for the author Brian “Beej Jorgensen” Hall for his amazing work on this book and the fact that he made it completely free and available online for everyone.

He's also written a couple other books and I see him as an amazing technical author capable of teaching programming and such skills using humour and presenting difficult topics in a rather easy-to-understand manner.

These notes expects you to have a decent understanding of programming using some other language assuming you already know what variables are, what loops do, how functions work etc. If you don't, you can continue reading on though it might be rather difficult.

Without further ado, let's get straight into it.
