This is my collection of notes about Maths! It's probably my second or third most favourite subject (Even though I suck at it). My first favourite subject is obviously Computer Science and programming.

I find Maths to be fascinating as it can be used for many, many things and it's just a wonderful thing to be very proficient at, however, as much as I like it, I really do suck at it. So don't take these notes to heart because they may have slight misinformation, and I definitely will not focus on writing notes about Maths because I don't like it as much as Linux and Computer Science of course.
