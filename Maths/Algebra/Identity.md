## Description
An identity is an equality that relates two expressions such that both expressions produces the same value for all values of the variables in the equality within a certain domain of discourse.

Identities are sometimes indicated by the triple bar symbol $\equiv$ instead of the equals sign $=$. Formally, an identity is a universally quantified identity.
