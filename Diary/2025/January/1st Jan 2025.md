Happy new year! 2024 went by pretty fast in my opinion. It was, an okay year I guess. Nothing really exciting happened, everything is still the same as it was more or less.

As always, we didn't celebrate. Our family doesn't celebrate anything. And because of religion, it's basically sinful to look at fireworks as it's like, attacking Allah by shooting fire and stuff at the sky. And of course, obviously we can't shoot our own fireworks as it's an even graver sin.

Today was a really boring day as always.
