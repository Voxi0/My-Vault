## Definition
The gel-like substance within a cell's membrane that surrounds the nucleus and contains all the organelles, providing a medium for chemical reactions and supporting cellular processes.

It's mainly composed of water, salts, and various other organic molecules including proteins.
## Functions
- **Supports cell structure** -> Cytoplasm helps maintain the cell's shape and provides a framework for the organelles.
- **Facilitates chemical reactions** -> Cytoplasm is where many essential metabolic processes and chemical reactions takes place.
- **Transport and storage** -> Cytoplasm facilitates the transport of nutrients and other molecules within the cell, and it also stores molecules used for cellular processes.
- **Organelle suspension** -> It suspends and holds the organelles in place, allowing them to function properly.
## In Prokaryotic Cells
In prokaryotic cells like bacteria, the cytoplasm includes everything within the cell membrane, as they lack a membrane-bound nucleus.
## In Eukaryotic Cells
In eukaryotic cells like plant and animal cells, the cytoplasm includes all the materials inside the cell and outside of the nucleus where organelles are located.
