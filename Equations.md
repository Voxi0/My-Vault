## Description
An equation is a mathematical formula consisting of any two expressions that are connected with an $=$ (Equals) sign, expressing the equality.

There are two kinds of equations - Identities and conditional. An [Identity](Identity.md) equation is true for all values of the variables while a conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.
## Solving An Equation
Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables makes the equality true.
